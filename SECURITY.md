# Security Policy

## Project: DGB-Quantum-Shield-Orchestrator
**Maintainer:** DarekDGB  
**License:** MIT  
**Status:** Shield Contract v3 (deterministic, fail-closed)

---

## 📌 Scope of This Repository

This repository implements the **v3 orchestration layer** of the DigiByte Quantum Shield.

It is responsible for:
- deterministically coordinating Shield Contract v3 components
- enforcing strict evaluation order
- synthesizing a single, fail-closed security envelope
- forwarding results to Adaptive Core as a **read-only sink**

This repository **does NOT**:
- hold private keys
- sign transactions
- execute blockchain actions
- hold authority outside the explicit v3 orchestration contract
- self-upgrade or self-modify

All behavior is **deny-by-default** unless explicitly extended in future versions.

---

## 🔐 Security Model

The orchestrator follows these core principles:

- **Fail-Closed by Default**  
  Any error, ambiguity, or missing component results in a `DENY` outcome.

- **Deterministic Execution**  
  No randomness, time dependence, or order variance is permitted.

- **No Hidden Authority**  
  The orchestrator cannot escalate privileges or override downstream systems.

- **Read-Only Intelligence Integration**  
  Adaptive Core receives reports but cannot influence outcomes.

- **Explicit Contracts**  
  All inputs, outputs, reason codes, and hashes are contract-defined and test-locked.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

Security properties are enforced through:
- contract-first design
- negative-first test coverage
- deterministic hashing tests
- fail-closed behavior tests
- CI-enforced 100% full package coverage

If tests pass, the contract behavior is considered authoritative. Any reduction below 100% coverage is treated as a release-blocking defect for v3.1.0 hardening.

---

## 🚨 Reporting a Security Issue

If you discover a potential security issue, vulnerability, or architectural concern:

### ✅ Preferred contact
- Open a **private GitHub Security Advisory**, or
- Contact the maintainer directly via GitHub profile (DarekDGB)

### ❌ Please do NOT
- Open public issues for unverified vulnerabilities
- Share exploit details publicly before coordination
- Assume unintended behavior is exploitable (fail-closed is intentional)

---

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|-------|-----------|
| v3    | ✅ Yes |
| v2    | ❌ No (legacy) |

Only **Shield Contract v3** behavior is supported or reviewed.

---

## 🧭 Future Security Work

Planned future work may include:
- explicit policy synthesis modules
- external signal verification
- formal audits
- Adamantine Wallet OS integration

These changes will occur **only via explicit versioned upgrades**.
